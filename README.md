When it comes to games, Kivi offers an extensive database of titles from which users can browse and add them to their collection. This enables them to share their gaming preferences with other players. Each user can also create their own communities or join existing ones, where they can post content. Community founders have complete control over their content, including the ability to change the community's image, name, and description, or delete the community entirely.

Every post in the Kivi app can be rated by other users, who can like or dislike it, as well as leave comments. While creating posts in the Kivi app, users can also add photos, which adds visual appeal to their content. The post's author has the option to delete or edit their entry, and editing will display information about the edit. The comment system works similarly, with users able to react with "like" or "dislike" to each comment and respond to them. Comment authors can edit or delete their comments as well.

In addition to these features, Kivi also allows real-time messaging, enabling users to chat with each other in real-time. Furthermore, users can set their preferred theme from a palette of 12 different colors, giving them the freedom to customize their app experience according to their preferences.

Kivi also features a real-time notification system, allowing users to stay updated on interactions and messages. Users can search for other players through the "Explore" tab and manage their search history, deciding whether to delete individual queries or the entire history.

Furthermore, users have the option to save posts of interest in the "Saved" section, where they can store their favorite content.

Kivi is the perfect platform for gamers to share their passions, gain inspiration, and build communities.
